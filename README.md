#  Custom Nuke Tools - User Guide and Problem-Solving Showcase

Hello i am Martin Tomek am Compositor and TD. And i would like to share with world some scripts that makes my life easier while working in Nuke. 


# Nuke Grab Tool

## Overview
I was missing the grab tool functionality from the Blender shading page. So I created this Nuke script, that replicates it in Nuke. It is really handy when zoomed out in the node graph. Just press E and move things around! Made with Claude.

## Key Features
- Blender-inspired 'grab' functionality
- Keyboard shortcut activation ('E')
- Confirm with left-click or Enter, cancel with Esc

## Problem Solved
Addresses the difficulty of organizing nodes in complex Nuke scripts, especially when zoomed out or working with intricate arrangements.

## 1. Sequence Loader

### Problem Solved
Artists and supervisors were spending excessive time manually importing and arranging shots for review, leading to inefficient workflows and increased risk of errors.

### Solution Overview
The Sequence Loader automates the process of loading and arranging multiple shot sequences for review.

### Key Features and Usage
- **Automatic Sequence Detection**: 
  - Usage: The tool detects the current sequence number from the Nuke script name.
  - User Tip: You can manually input sequence numbers for non-standard naming conventions.

- **Multi-Sequence Support**: 
  - Usage: Load multiple sequences in a single operation.
  - User Tip: The tool remembers and suggests the next logical sequence number for quick iterations.
 
### User Benefits
- Significant time savings in review preparation
- Reduced cognitive load when dealing with multiple sequences
- Consistent presentation of shots for more effective reviews

## 2. Mask Checker: Automating Quality Control

### Problem Solved
Manual inspection of mask channels was time-consuming and prone to human error, potentially leading to costly mistakes in final compositions.

### Solution Overview
The Mask Checker automates the process of verifying and visualizing mask channels 

- **Grade Node Integration**: 
  - Usage: Applies a Grade node to each shuffled mask for enhanced visibility.
  - User Tip: Easily adjust mask intensity for better visualization.

### Impact
- Reduced mask checking time
- Significantly decreased mask-related errors in final renders
- Standardized the QC process across the studio

### User Benefits
- Faster and more thorough mask verification
- Reduced risk of overlooking errors in complex, multi-channel renders

## 3. Lock Cryptos: Mitigating Critical Bugs

### Problem Solved
A severe bug in our Cryptomatte workflow was causing unexpected layer changes, leading to numerous compositing errors and wasted render time.

### Solution Overview
Lock Cryptos automates the locking and labeling of Cryptomatte nodes to prevent unintended layer changes.

### Key Features and Usage
- **Automatic Cryptomatte Detection and Analysis**: 
  - Usage: Scans the Nuke script to identify all Cryptomatte nodes.
  - User Tip: Works on both individual nodes and entire node trees.

- **Layer Locking Mechanism**: 
  - Usage: Automatically locks the correct Cryptomatte layer for each node.
  - User Tip: Prevents the bug from changing the layer selection unexpectedly.

- **Dynamic Labeling**: 
  - Usage: Updates each Cryptomatte node's label to clearly show the locked layer.
  - User Tip: Provides immediate visual confirmation of the correct layer selection.

### Impact
- Completely eliminated a major source of subtle, hard-to-detect compositing errors
- Saved countless hours of troubleshooting and error correction
- Improved overall render accuracy and artist confidence

## 4. ZDefocus Controller: Enhancing Depth of Field Workflows

### Problem Solved
Managing multiple defocus nodes across complex compositions was leading to inconsistencies and time-consuming setups.

### Solution Overview
The ZDefocus Controller centralizes the management of multiple PxF_ZDefocusHERO nodes

### Key Features and Usage
- **Centralized Control**: 
  - Usage: Manages all PxF_ZDefocusHERO nodes from a single, user-friendly interface.
  - User Tip: Allows global adjustments to focal plane, f-stop, and focal length.

- **Automatic Camera Integration**: 
  - Usage: Reads and applies camera data to defocus settings automatically.

- **Render Farm Compatibility**: 
  - Usage: Utilizes Nuke's 'executing' flag to ensure defocus nodes are always active during farm rendering.

### Impact
- Reduced defocus setup time 
- Minimized depth-of-field calculation errors
- Improved overall composition quality and consistency


## Installation and Setup

1. Download the tools package 
2. Place the scripts in your Nuke plugins directory (e.g., `~/.nuke` or a studio-wide location).
3. Add the following line to your `init.py` file:
   ```python
   nuke.pluginAddPath("/path/to/custom_tools")
   ```
4. Restart Nuke to load the new tools.

## Conclusion

These tools represent my approach as a Technical Director: identifying critical workflow challenges, developing innovative solutions, and implementing them in ways that significantly enhance productivity and quality in VFX production. By addressing common pain points in the VFX pipeline, these tools not only showcase technical proficiency but also demonstrate a deep understanding of artists' needs and production requirements.

For users, these tools offer significant time savings, improved consistency, and enhanced quality control in daily VFX tasks. They're designed with user-friendliness in mind, integrating seamlessly into existing workflows while providing powerful automation and standardization capabilities.

As a Technical Director, I'm committed to continually refining and expanding this toolkit based on user feedback and evolving production needs. I encourage users to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or specific workflow challenges that might benefit from similar custom solutions.
